# Nyrion Swift

Nyrion Swift is a lightweight, Aeon-based CLI built to deliver speed, reliability, and simplicity.
After the success of Aeon, which has now officially reached end of feature support, Nyrion Swift continues its legacy — rebuilt from the ground up with a modern foundation and a sharper focus on performance and maintainability.

**Background Story**

The Aeon CLI started as an experimental tool for developers who wanted a clean and modular command-line experience. Over time, it grew into a reliable companion for many, but its architecture eventually reached its limits.
To address this, I introduced the QopWarren prefix system,  a more structured and flexible base that allowed for faster development, better scalability, and long-term sustainability. 
QopWarren was only meant for Atlas, But I had to make an leap forward in Nyrion CLI.

With these advancements, Nyrion Swift was born — an evolution, not just a successor. It retains the spirit of Aeon while bringing a more optimized and future-ready approach.
